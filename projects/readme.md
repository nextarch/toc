# NextArch Project Proposal Process

## Introduction
This governance policy sets forth the proposal process for projects to be accepted into the NextArch Foundation. 

## Project stages
NextArch projects have a maturity level of incubating and graduated, which corresponds to the Innovators, Early Adopters, and Early Majority tiers of the Crossing the Chasm diagram. 
The maturity level is a signal by NextArch as to what sorts of enterprises should be adopting different projects. 
Projects increase their maturity by demonstrating their sustainability to NextArch’s Technical Oversight Committee(TOC).

### Project donation process
- You can set up a proposal by submitting an issue in the [TOC repo](https://github.com/nextarch/toc).
  - The information should contain the project name, Area, Abstract, Goal, SIG belonging, and Presentation Materials.
  - If the project doesn’t belong to any existing SIG, you can submit an issue in the toc repo to discuss whether to set up a new SIG.

- The SIG that the new project belongs will review the project and give advice. After improvement, the SIG Tech Leader will recommend the project to TOC.
- TOC will vote for the project at the TOC meeting and announce it at the meeting (approved by a two-thirds vote).
- The incubation of the projects will be determined by TOC in the future.

### Incubation process
All exceptions (and "no" outcomes) are handled by the TOC.

1. Project Proposal
   - Project proposed through a issue in the [TOC repo](https://github.com/nextarch/toc).

2. TOC Review
   - The TOC may agree that the project does not (yet) meet the Incubation requirements and give feedback on why this is the case. 
   - TOC reviews proposal and presentation materials in issue, project passes for inclusion with two-thirds vote of TOC
   - TOC may engage with project to ask further questions
   - If the vote is not conclusive after 6 weeks, TOC may extend vote, or conclude that silence = abstain

### Graduation process
TBD
