In various situations the NextArch TOC shall hold a vote. These votes can happen on the email, or via meeting when appropriate. TOC members can either respond "agree, yes, +1", "disagree, no, -1", or "abstain". A vote passes with two-thirds vote of votes cast. An abstain vote equals not voting at all.
