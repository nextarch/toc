# NextArch Foundation Special Interest Groups ("SIGs")

## Overall Purpose
Scale contributions by the NextArch Foundation technical and user community, while retaining integrity and increasing quality in support of our mission.

## Introduction
NextArch SIGs will oversee and coordinate the interests pertaining to a logical area of needs of end users and/or projects. 
The area overseen by a SIG is typically met by a set of NextArch Foundation projects, and may also represent a cross-cutting feature group shared by several projects. SIG’s are:

long lived groups that report to the TOC
led primarily by recognised experts in the relevant field(s), supported by other contributors.

## Tech Lead list of SIGs

Tips：
Tech Lead Responsibilities.
- Assist TOC in the daily operation of SIG and develop SIG annual plan.
- Tech Lead is valid for 1 year (elected by the initiating member or voted by everyone, can be elected continuously).
- Regularly synchronize with TOC on SIG status (e.g. email/toc meeting, etc.).

## Responsibilities of Specific SIGs
**Project Handling:**

- Understand and document a high level roadmap of projects within this space, including NextArch and non-NextArch projects. Identify gaps in project landscape.
- For projects that fall within the NextArch, perform health checks.
- Perform discovery of and outreach to candidate projects.
- Help candidate projects prepare for presentation to the TOC.
- Every project should choose one suitable SIG to join as a necessary part of donating to NextArch.

**End User Education (Outbound Communication)**
- Provide up-to-date, high quality, unbiased and easy-to-consume material to help end users to understand and effectively adopt technologies and practises within the SIG’s area, for example:
   - White papers, presentations, videos, or other forms of training clarifying terminology, comparisons of different approaches, available projects or products, common or recommended practises, trends, illustrative successes and failures, etc.
   - As far as possible, information should be based on research and fact gathering, rather than pure marketing or speculation.

**End User Input Gathering (Inbound Communication)**
- Gather useful end user input and feedback regarding expectations, pain points, primary use cases etc.

**Community Enablement**
- SIGs are open organizations with meetings, meeting agendas and notes, mailing lists, and other communications in the open.


## Operating Model
- Organize internal Meeting regularly to ensure the efficiency of SIG annual plan implementation.
- Discover and promote the candidate projects.

## Exit Model
- If the SIG is not active enough for one year, it is recommended that SIG Tech Lead/TOC members initiate a SIG withdrawal/adjustment request.

## How to Set Up SIGs
You can set up a SIG by submitting an [issue](https://github.com/nextarch/toc/issues) and a [PR for approval](proposed.md).

The proposed SIGs will be reported to the TOC, and the TOC will vote to determine the launch and SIG Tech Lead.
