# Proposed SIGs

The information should contain SIG name, Area, Abstract, Goal, and Presentation Materials.

The proposed SIGs will be reported to the TOC, and the TOC will vote to determine the launch (approved by a two-thirds vote).

The proposed SIGs must include the participation of 3-5 Foundation members, as well as the election of a SIG Tech Lead.

A new repo of the SIG will be created after that.


| Name (to be finalised)  |    Area     |  SIG Abstract  |  SIG Goal  | PPT/Doc or Any Reference| 
| ------------------------|-------------|---------------|------------| ----------------------- | 
| SIG-Edge (Proposal)| Edge Computing | Edge computing includes many concepts, include On-Premise solution, Distributed Cloud, Geo-distributed Database, Edge-aware Serverless, etc., which can be roughly understood as "non-public cloud" architecture projects. | Clarify landscape, manage sub SIG-Edge, Collaborate and interrelate projects, Atract new projects.  |  | 
| SIG-MSG (Proposal)| Streaming and Messaging | Streaming and Messaging projects are the key architect component of the enterprise infrastructure, which include Apache Pulsar, Apache Kafka, RabitMQ, etc.  | Clarify landscape, manage sub SIG-MSG, Collaborate and interrelate projects, Atract new projects.  |  | 
| SIG-CloudDev (Proposal)| Cloud Dev, Cloud Hosting, Low-Code, No-Code, Cloud Funtion, Serverless, etc. | Compared with traditional development, people only need to write a few codes or no code to build a complete application by the low-code development method. FaaS, BaaS, aPaaS, low-code even no-code are becoming popular these years. SIG-CloudDev will combine these tools or platforms to ease building applications. |  SIG-CloudDev will combine low-code, no-code, and serverless tools or platforms to help users build applications more efficiently and digital transformation more easily. |  |
| SIG-DevOps  |    DevOps(CI/CD etc)     | DevOps is the 3rd generation of Software Engineering.Every enterprise in digital transformation needs DevOps to digitalize its way to produce software,SIG-DevOps is founded to support the open-source software in DevOps area.  |  Attract and incubate more open-source software in DevOps area and promote the adoption of DevOps way to help enterprise build software more efficiently and in high quality and security.| | 
|SIG-OpenObservability (Proposal) |Cloud Native Computing, Troubleshooting, Performance| With the rapid scaling of cloud native computing, the probability of system/application fault is dramatically increasing. Consequently, troubleshooting becomes more difficult and complicated. SIG-OpenObservability aims to make troubleshooting as efficient and painless as possible, either from the perspective of tackling issues or tracing performance. The eBPF-based SIG-OpenObservability will be used extensively to drive a wide variety of use cases, e.g., extracting fine-grained key observability data at low overhead from linux kernel subsystems (MM, CPU, Net, Block IO, etc.), helping application developers trace applications, providing insights for performance troubleshooting, and much more. | SIG-OpenObservability is event driven, i.e., it extracts observability data when linux kernel events that we take care of, occurs. With this data, it is easy to figure out what the root cause of issues. More importantly, SIG-OpenObservability can trace linux kernel/applications for performance troubleshooting because we can also sample the data, then generate a CPU flame graph effectively.| |
| SIG-Microservice (Proposal)| Microservice Governance | The microservice architecture is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are highly maintainable and testable, loosely coupled, independently deployable, owned by a small team. It enables the rapid, frequent and reliable delivery of large and complex applications. It also enables an organization to evolve its technology stack.  | SIG-Microservice is committed to providing a standardized service discovery and governance solution for distributed and microservice architecture. It applies to heterogeneous infrastructure such as multi-language, multi-framework, different runtime environments and hybrid cloud scenario. | |
